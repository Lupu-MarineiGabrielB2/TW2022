Their most frequently used habitats are mountains with deciduous and conifer trees, and bamboo understory.","diet":"Just like the giant panda, the red panda is a bamboo eater and its diet is mainly bamboo. During summers, the red panda may feed on fruits, mushrooms, leaves, grasses, roots, fruits, lichens and acorns. Although considered herbivorous, the red panda will occasionally take birds eggs and it is speculated that they may eat mice and birds on occasions.","lifespan":"8-14 YRS","species":"Mammal","continent":"Asia, ","order":"Omnivora","biome":"Temperate Deciduous Forest, Woodland, Tropical Savanna, ","conservationStatus":"Endangered","description":"Red pandas have soft, dense fur that protects them from cool temperatures.

During this time, the female will make a nest out of grass and twigs in either a hollow tree or rock crevasse. Up to 3 newborn cubs are then delivered into the nest.

Red panda cubs start to take on the adult red panda coloration at about 90 days old. Red panda cubs are weaned at 5 months and stay with their mother until the next litter is about to be born, which is about a year after their birth.\r\n\r\nMale red pandas do not share the raising of the cubs, it is completely left to the mother red panda to raise and care for the cubs herself.
