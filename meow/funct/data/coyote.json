Coyotes also occur as far north as Alaska and Canada. The name \u2018Coyote\u2019 is from the Mexican Spanish language and its scientific name means \u2018barking dog\u2019. The coyote is one of 8 species of the genus Canis. Four of these are jackals of Europe, Africa and Asia.\r\n\r\nOther members of the genus include the Grey Wolf (Canis lupus), the Red Wolf (Canis rufus) and all the breeds of the domestic dog (Canis familiaris).\r\n\r\nCOYOTE DESCRIPTION\r\n\r\n\r\nCoyotes measure around 75 \u2013 87 centimetres (30 \u2013 34 inches) in length and weigh on average 7 \u2013 21 kilograms (15 \u2013 46 pounds). They have a tail length of 40 \u2013 60 inches which becomes bushy and is held horizontally when the Coyote displays aggression. Coyotes in the north of their range are generally larger than southern species. Coyotes are known to reach their maximum size within their first year whereas wolves reach their maximum size in their second year.\r\n\r\nA coyotes fur varies in color from a greyish brown to a yellow\/grey color. Their throats and underparts are generally lighter in color, mostly white. They have reddish\/brown forelegs, sides of head, muzzle and feet. Their under fur is beige and they have long, black tipped guard hairs that form a black dorsal stripe and a dark cross on the shoulder area. Coyotes have a tail with a black tip on the end. Their tail has a scent gland situated on its\u2019 dorsal base.\r\n\r\nCoyotes have large ears even though they have a small head and their feet are small in comparison with the rest of their body. Coyotes molt once a year starting in May and ending in July. Like domestic dogs, coyotes have sweat glands on their paws. The coyote has 5 digits on the forefeet, including the dew claw (remnants of a 5th digit) and 4 digits on the hind feet. Coyotes are digitigrades meaning they walk with only their toes touching the ground.","reproduction":"Coyote breeding season occurs between late January and late March. Female coyotes are monoestrous (having one estrous cycle per year) and remain on heat for 2 \u2013 5 days. When the female finds the right partner, they remain monogamous (having one partner during a period of time) for a number of years.\r\n\r\nThe female coyote gestation period lasts 60 \u2013 63 days after which a litter ranging from 1 \u2013 19 pups are born (average is 6 pups). Unfortunately, over half coyote pups do not survive to adulthood. Coyote pups weigh around 250 grams at birth and are blind and limp eared. Their eyes open and their ears become erect after 10 days. The pups emerge from their birth dens after 21 \u2013 28 days. They drink their mothers milk for about 5 to 7 weeks and are fully weaned after 35 days.\r\n\r\nBoth parents feed the pups after weaning with regurgitated food. At the age of 6 \u2013 9 months, male pups leave their dens while female pups remain with their parents and form the basis of the pack. Pups are fully grown at the age of 9 \u2013 12 months and also reach sexual maturity although most do not breed until the age of 2 years. The life span of a coyote is up to 10 \u2013 14 years in the wild and 18 years in captivity.","conservationStatusPara":"Coyotes are classed as \u2018Least Concern\u2019 by the IUCN. Cougars sometimes kill coyotes. The coyotes instinctive fear of cougars has led to the development of anti-coyote sound systems which repel coyotes from public places by replicating the sounds of a cougar.","funFacts":"Coyotes listen out for danger and can detect hunters at a distance of one mile.\r\nCoyotes walk silently on the tips of their toes to avoid danger.","naturalEnemies":"Golden Eagle\r\nWolf\r\nAmerican Alligator","relatedAnimal1":"American Alligator","relatedAnimal2":"Sheep","relatedAnimal3":"Mountain Lion"}
